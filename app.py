    >> Developer Salary Prediction App <<
    This Streamlit application predicts developer salary using multiple machine learning models including LGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest regressors. 
    Users can input developer information through a user-friendly interface, which includes fields such as country, education level, and years of experience.
        
    > Features:
        **Input Components**: 
        - **MainBranch**: Select your main area of expertise in development, such as software engineering, data science, or web development. This selection may influence salary expectations based on the branch's demand and trends.
        
        - **Country**: Choose your country from the dropdown list. Regions often exhibit varying salary scales due to economic factors, the cost of living, and market demand for tech workers.
        
        - **Education Level**: Indicate the highest level of education you have completed. Higher educational qualifications often correlate with higher earning potential in the tech industry.
        
        - **Remote Work**: Specify whether you primarily work remotely, on-site, or in a hybrid setup. Remote work setups can affect salary offers, especially if hiring companies are based in different geographic areas.
        
        - **CompTotal**: Enter your expected total compensation, which includes salary, bonuses, and other benefits. This field is crucial for setting a base for salary predictions and facilitates comparisons.
        
        - **Years of Experience**: Provide the number of years you've been in a coding-related job. Generally, more years of experience are associated with higher salaries due to skill accumulation and professional development.
        
        **Data Processing**: 
        - The app employs a pre-processed dataset, cleaned and prepared for model training. 
        - It utilizes features including country, education level, and years of experience for predictions.
        - Models are loaded from disk, obtaining predictions based on user-provided input.

        **Prediction**: The app performs predictions with loaded models and calculates performance metrics like R2 score.
        **Results Display**: The predicted salary and model performance metrics are presented in a user-friendly format.
        
    > Usage: 
       Fill out the developer information and click "Predict Salary" to derive insights on anticipated salary and model performance.
       
    > Disclaimer: 
       This application serves educational purposes. Predictions are not guaranteed to be accurate.
